## :heart: Thanks for taking a short view of my in-progress projects :heart:

Here you will find some different kind of repositories, for now I'm trying to stand my professional profile so all you will see deployed, are part of my study program in Web Development.

Currently I'm looking to find my way in either Front-End or Back-End, but as far as I'm studying I'm more focused in enjoying the process.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my life's extreme make over.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development at Factoria F5- Barcelona.
- 💬 Ask me about Web development: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel.
- 📫 How to reach me:

- ⚡ Fun fact about my live cycle: 
    I studied Library Science...
    I studied Acting...
    I studied Administration...
  All of them I'm one year left to go.
  I'm 27years old.
